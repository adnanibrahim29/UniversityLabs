These two files are a little different. 

In the first version (baseConverterV1):
Uses a try-catch method and uses Integer.parseInt to convert into decimal
Then uses Integer.toString to convert decimal value to the target base and returns as a string

In the second version (baseConverterV2):
The program does the conversion manually and uses a boolean to check if the number is negative.
If it is negative add a "-" in front of the number.
