Description
Part A: Animal.java
Create a class called Animal, That should include the following:

1. A String attribute named animalDiet & a String attribute named animalSound.
2. A default constructor which should set both string attribute’s values to “undefined”.
3. A second constructor which takes two String parameters and sets the animalDiet and animalSound to these parameters.
4. Getter and setter methods for animalDiet and animalSound.
5. A method, called printDetails(), to print the attributes created in the format shown below.

Part B:
Create separate classes for each of the classes: Horse, Dog and Tiger in the relevant files. Use the keyword extends to make these classes inherit from the Animal class. In each of these classes create a default constructor which makes a call to the superclass default constructor. In each of these classes create a second constructor which takes two String parameters and makes a call to the superclass constructor passing it these values.

Part C:
In the Dog Class:

1. Create an int attribute called numDogBiscuitsEaten.
2. Add code to both of the Dog constructors that sets numDogBiscuitsEaten to 0.
3. Add a getter method for the attribute numDogBiscuitsEaten called getBiscuitsEaten().
4. Add a method called eatDogBiscuit() which will have no parameters and will not return anything but will add one to numDogBiscuitsEaten.

Part D:
In the Horse Class:

1. Create an int attribute called speed.
2. Add code to the default Horse constructor that sets speed to 35.
3. Add code to the 2nd Horse constructor that changes speed to a value passed to the constructor (Do not remove other parameters.).
4. Getter and setter methods for speed

Part E:
Create a tester class GeneralTester which is a simple program with a main method.

1. Create a Dog object using it’s default constructor.
2. A Tiger object with the values "omnivore" and "purr" for it’s inherited attributes.
3. A Horse object with the values "herbivore", "neigh" and 40.
4. Call the printDetails() method on the Dog object.
5. Set the Dog inherited animalSound attribute to “woof”.
6. Call the Dog eatDogBiscuit() method on the Dog object.
7. Call the printDetails() method on the Dog object again. Use a print statement and the getBiscuitsEaten() method to print the value returned to the screen.
8. Call the printDetails() method on the Horse object.
9. Set the Horse object’s speed attribute to 48. Use the appropriate getter method to return the updated speed attribute and print it to the screen.
10. Set the Tiger object’s inherited animalDiet attribute to “carnivore”.
11. Call printDetails() on the Tiger object.
