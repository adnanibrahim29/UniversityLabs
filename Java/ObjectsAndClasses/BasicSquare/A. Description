Description

Part A:
Write a class to represent a Square called BasicSquare. This should include the following:

1. A single attribute named len.
2. A default constructor which will set the value of len to 1.
3. A general constructor which should set the len to a value which is passed to the constructor.
4. Getter and setter methods for the len attribute.
5. A method called getPerimeter to calculate and return the perimeter of the BasicSquare.
6. A method called getArea to calculate and return the area of the BasicSquare.

Part B:
Write a main method in a new class called TestBasicSquare and in this method:

1. Create three BasicSquare objects using the default constructor.
2. The len of each square should be set by user input using the setLen method.
3. Print the length of the side of each square object (see sample output below).
4. Use the getPerimeter() method and print the perimeter of each square.
5. Use the getArea() method and print the area of each square (see sample output below).

Output
The TestBasicSquare class should print to the screen the correct message to match each part of the questions given above.

Sample Output - output should be exactly as below:

    Square 1 has a side of length 5 
    Square 2 has a side of length 7 
    Square 3 has a side of length 3 
    Square 1 has a perimeter of 20 
    Square 2 has a perimeter of 28 
    Square 3 has a perimeter of 122 
    Square 1 has an area of 25 
    Square 2 has an area of 49 
    Square 3 has an area of 9
