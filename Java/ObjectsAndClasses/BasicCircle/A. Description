Description

Part A:
Write a class to represent a Circle called BasicCircle. This should include the following:

1 . A single attribute named radius.
2. A default constructor which will set the value of radius to 1.
3. A general constructor which should set the radius to a value which is passed to the constructor.
4. Getter and setter methods for the radius attribute.
5. A method called getCircumference to calculate and return the circumference of the BasicCircle to 2 decimal places (see apendix). You should use Math.PI in this method.
6. A method called getArea to calculate and return the area of the BasicCircle to 2 decimal places (see apendix). You should use Math.PI in this method.

Part B:
Write a main method in a new class called TestBasicCircle and in this method:

1. Create three BasicCircle objects.
2. The radius of each circle should be set by user input.
3. Print the radius of each circle object (see sample output below).
4. Use the getCircumference() method and print the circumference of each circle.
5. Use the getArea() method and print the area of each circle (see sample output below).

Appendix:
In the below example, num1 will have a value of 43.36 after the piece of code is run.

double num1=Math.round(43.3565656 * 100.0) / 100.0;
To use Math.round & Math.pow include:

import java.lang.Math.*;

Output
The TestBasicCircle class should print to the screen the correct message to match each part of the questions given above.

Sample Output - output should be exactly as below:

    Circle 1 has a radius of 5 
    Circle 2 has a radius of 7 
    Circle 3 has a radius of 3 
    Circle 1 has a circumference of 31.42 
    Circle 2 has a circumference of 43.98 
    Circle 3 has a circumference of 18.85 
    Circle 1 has an area of 78.54 
    Circle 2 has an area of 153.94 
    Circle 3 has an area of 28.27
