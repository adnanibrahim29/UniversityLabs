Description

Part A:
Write a class to represent a Dice called Dice. This should include the following:

1. An attribute named numOfSides for the number of sides of our Dice.
2. An attribute named faceValue which holds the value of the current face up side of the Dice.
3. A default constructor which will set the value of numOfSides to 6 and generate a random number (see Appendix A) as an integer between 1 and 6 for faceValue.
4. A general constructor which should set the numOfSides and faceValue to values which is passed to the constructor.
5. Getter methods for the numOfSides and faceValue attributes called getNumOfSides and getFaceValue.
6. A Setter method called setNumOfSides to set the value of numOfSides.
7. A method called rollDice which takes no input parameters and will set the faceValue to a random number between 1 and numOfSides it will then return the value of faceValue.

Part B:
Write a main method in a new class called Game and in this method:

1. Create some Dice objects by using the default and general constructors.
2. Use the getNumOfSides method on one of the Dice objects.
3. Use the getFaceValue method on one of the Dice objects.
4. Use the setNumOfSides method on one of the Dice objects.
5. Use the rollDice method on the Dice objects to roll your Die.

Important Note:
For this question you will be graded on creating the methods given in Part A and for using them correctly in Part B.

Appendix A:
To generate a random number in Java you must first important Random at the top of your code.

    import java.util.Random;

You must then create a Random object in your code.

    Random rn = new Random();

The following line will then generate a random number between 1 and 10 and store it in answer.

    int answer = rn.nextInt(10) + 1;
