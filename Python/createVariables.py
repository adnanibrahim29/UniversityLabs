"""
Write a Python program that:
1. Declares an integer, called num1, and sets its value to be 12.
2. Declares a double, called num2, and sets its value to be 123.4.
3. Declares a character variable, called letter, and sets its value to be 'c'.
4. Prints each initialised variable on a new line.

You must not use print statements to print out the 12, 123.4 or c, but use them to print out the variables using their names.

Note: You must use the variable names and values given.
